            <p class="innovations-150-item__black-header">Breeding Apples</p>
            <p>Purdue University has the largest apple-breeding program in the world. Jules Janick, apple geneticist,
                has created more than 20 varieties of apples and pears. The partnership with Rutgers,
                the State University of New Jersey and the University of Illinois dates back to 1945,
                as researchers looked to breed apples resistant to scab caused by a fungal pathogen. Up to the present,
                1,500 selections have been made, of which 44 have been released for advanced testing.
                A number of the advanced selections have been patented.</p>
